// Consolidation
// Benefits of using DOM templates:
// Separation of structure and logic, multiple code reuse, simplification of interface updates, increase readability, reduction of errors, acceleration of development.
// Web workers:
// This is a JavaScript mechanism that allows scripts to be executed in a background thread separate from the main execution thread. Their main function is to perform heavy computational tasks without blocking the user interface.
// How web workers improve performance:
// Prevent blocking of the main thread, ensure continuous operation of the interface during calculations, allow parallel operations, effectively use multi-core processors.
// Deployment:
// The process of transferring finished program code from the developer's working environment to the target server or hosting for general user access.
// Difference between async and defer:
// Both attributes allow scripts to be loaded without blocking HTML parsing. Scripts with async are executed immediately after loading, without waiting for parsing to complete. Scripts with defer are executed only after HTML parsing is complete, preserving the order of execution.
